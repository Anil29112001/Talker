# Future Ready Talent Project
# Project title: Talker: text-to-speech-converter
# Industry Name: Ed-Tech
# Problem Statement: 
The world health organization estimates around 285 million visually impaired people in the world, out of which 39 million are blind so these peoples are not able to read text. Language barrier is one of the biggest issue which can be seen across borders and due to this issue people are not able to learn new languages. Many children have a hard time focusing and are easily distracted by long passages and words. Also there are many children in schools having some sort of disabilities. Many people are poor in language and they don’t know correct pronunciation of specific words. So to overcome these issues there is the need of "Text-to-Speech" application which converts text into natural-sounding audio.
# Project Description:
Talker is a “text-to-speech” web application which converts text into speech. It enables the user to copy text into textbox and converts it into natural sounding audio. The output audio is natural and clear so user can hear it clearly. It mainly focuses at conversion of written text to speech in any given language. The application is available in multi-language form, so user can select any language from the dropdown list. It has pause button to pause the audio and resume button to resume the audio from where the user has stopped. It is a responsive and multi language supported web application.
# Existing System
There was no tool earlier to convert text to speech. It was difficult for users to continuously read the text on screen. Some users had the tasks of reading extensive content on the screen. There was no automation available to convert the text to speech. For people who are the area of content writing and proof reading, the task is difficult which requires them to read an extensive number of books online.
# Proposed System
This is a simple program which can be moved anywhere on desktop. This application synthesises the text to speech. There are no hassles of login and password. The user can install this application and can start using. It enables the user to copy text into clipboard and converts the selected text to audio. The audio which is played is very natural. The user can pause the audio at any time. The user can replay it back at the point he has stopped
